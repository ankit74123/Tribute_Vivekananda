                <h2>Indian Philosopher </h2>
                <p> <b>Swami Vivekananda</b> (12 January 1863 –
                    4 July 1902), born Narendranath Datta, was an Indian Hindu monk,
                    philosopher, author, religious teacher, and the chief disciple of the Indian mystic
                    Ramakrishna.He was a key figure in the introduction of Vedanta and Yoga to the Western
                    world;and is credited with raising interfaith awareness, and bringing Hinduism to the
                    status of a major world religion.Vivekananda became a popular figure after the 1893 Parliament
                    of Religions in Chicago, where he began his famous speech with the words, "Sisters and brothers of
                    America...," before introducing Hinduism to Americans. He was so impactful at the Parliament
                    that an American newspaper described him as, “an orator by divine right and undoubtedly the greatest
                    figure at the Parliament”.After great success at the Parliament, in the subsequent years,
                    Vivekananda delivered hundreds of lectures across the United States, England and Europe,
                    disseminating the core tenets of Hindu philosophy, and founded the Vedanta Society of New York and
                    the Vedanta Society of San Francisco (now Vedanta Society of Northern California), both of which
                    became the foundations for Vedanta Societies in Western world.</p>
